# ZK Proofs Teaching Tool

### We'll create a circuit that tries to prove we are able to factor a number.

1. The circuit will have 2 private inputs and 1 output.
2. The output signal c must be the value of signal a times signal b.
3. We instantiate the circuit and assign it to the main component. The component main must always exist.

### We'll also try to connect it to our front-end

1. Which will let the user input the two numbers and it will return true and false and a tutorial explaining mathematically how the zksnark did it. 
2. It would also provide resources after the puzzle, giving the user an entrance to the rabbit hole with good resources.
