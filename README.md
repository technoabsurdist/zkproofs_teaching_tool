# ZK Proofs Teaching Tool

### We'll create a circuit that tries to prove we are able to factor a number.

1. The circuit will have 2 private inputs and 1 output.
2. The output signal c must be the value of signal a times signal b.
3. We instantiate the circuit and assign it to the main component. The component main must always exist.




This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
